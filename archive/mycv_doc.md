(with Joon Song \[SKKU\])

> *Abstract*: Policymakers must often decide whether to pursue a policy
> that has uncertain benefits. The response of asset markets to proposed
> policy changes can be a valuable source of information for
> policy-setting. However, policymakers must take into account that an
> informed trader may anticipate this and protably manipulate the
> market. We show that it is optimal for policymakers to listen to asset
> markets, but they must commit (e.g., through political capital) to
> sometimes pursuing a policy even when the expected welfare effects are
> negative. Surprisingly, allowing traders to short-sell can make it
> easier for policymakers to induce truth-telling actions.

*(*With Gerhard Riener \[Dusseldorf\] and Danielle Vance-McMullen
\[DePaul\])

> *Abstract:* Are charitable gifts are complements or substitutes; are
> charitable fundraisers rivals? These questions are important to
> fundraisers, policymakers, and economic models of generosity. However,
> observational data lacks shocks that are clearly specific to giving to
> one charity; motivating experimental variation. We report on recent
> experimental work (our own and others') from a variety of laboratory
> and field settings, under a range of design choices providing
> convergent validation. Most work presents simultaneous or proximately
> repeated donation opportunities to subjects, with noticeably varying
> "prices", promotional information, and choice sets. Here, specific
> shocks strongly increase giving to the targeted charities, and lead to
> decreased giving to the remaining charities, particularly where
> charities serve similar goals. However, this may be driven by
> experimental demand and logical responses to obvious contrasts, which
> may not reflect real-world behavior. Our web-based experiments offer
> robustness to these critiques. We pay participants for completing two
> surveys unrelated to charitable giving, separated by multiple weeks.
> Some (all) participants have the opportunity to donate from their
> earnings to a single charity at the end of the first (second) survey.
> Between subjects, we vary the number of ask, the between-ask
> durations, and the similarity of the first and second charities. The
> results offer further evidence of "expenditure substitution", but less
> support for the idea that similar charities crowd out each other more,
> or that charitable giving is a perishable good.

**[[Exclude the bad actors, or learn about the
group]{.underline}](http://www.essex.ac.uk/economics/discussion-papers/Papers-text/dp750.pdf)**
(with David Hugh-Jones \[UEA\] and Hannes Titeca \[Exeter\])

> *Abstract:* Previous work finds that the threat of punishment or
> exclusion can increase contributions to public goods. However, not all
> behavior can be monitored and punished, and contributions induced
> under threat are less informative about true preferences. The
> resulting loss of information can lead conditionally-cooperative
> players to cooperate less when the threat is absent than they would
> have had there never been a threat. Our laboratory evidence \-- from a
> two-stage public goods game with exclusion \-- supports this account.
> Contributions under the threat of targeted exclusion were less
> informative of later choices than contributions made anonymously, and
> subjects realized this. We find evidence of conditional cooperation
> driven by beliefs over others\' contributions. Our Anonymous treatment
> led to lower first-stage contributions but significantly higher
> second-stage contributions than our Revealed treatment. This may help
> explain why real world institutions often encourage anonymous
> contributions and loosely monitor teamwork.
